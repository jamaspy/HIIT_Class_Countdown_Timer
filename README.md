# RBG-Color-Guessing-Game
 This was the first JavaScript lead project and was quite challenging in parts.

I am going to refactor it and then use it as practice committing to this repo.
Some of the code is duplicated and I can see areas where I can create functions and follow some better design patterns.

# The Aim Of The Game
Guess (by clicking on the coloured square) the randomly generated RBG Number shown at the top.
You can choose easy mode (3 Sqaures) or hard mode (6 squares). Adding more modes could be something to think about when I refactor it. 

Thanks
