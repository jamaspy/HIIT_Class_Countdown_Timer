# RBG-Color-Guessing-Game
This was a code along on my Udemy Course. If was the first JavaScript lead project and was quite challenging in parts.

I am going to refactor it and then use it as practice committing to this repo.
Some of the code is duplicated and I can see areas where I can create functions and follow some better design patterns.

Thanks
